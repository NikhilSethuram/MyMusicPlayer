# MyMusicPlayer
This is an user friendly Music Player purely coded in Java.
It uses the Queues linear data strucutre for its basic implementations and Java Swing to implement the simple and interactive GUI.
You can now listen to the audio files in your device using this Music Player.
It has several features such as adding a single song to the playlist or even adding an entire playlist using a file from your device. 
We can list out the songs in the playlist, clear the playlist if you wish to and finally play any song you desire to listen.
It is pretty fun to mess around with. So, go ahead and pop some music in your ears.
